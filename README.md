# UPStoDomoticz
This script retrieves information about an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) connected via USB and sends it to a Domoticz home automation system. The script uses the Network UPS Tools (NUT) software to communicate with the UPS and retrieves information such as battery voltage, input and output voltage, input frequency, and UPS load.
